            <p>Demo Day was an excellent chance for attendees to meet the rising crop of San Francisco native rock star game developers and get an update on Mission Bit's plans for the 2014/2015 school year.</p>
            
            <p> The summer 2014 mobile game development class was sponsored by WeChat and supported by co.lab, The Salesforce Foundation, AdRoll, BrightRoll, Rackspace//Geekdom, Hack Reactor, Tagged, Chartboost, Zynga.org, DeNA and Glu Mobile. And Pocket Gems generously hosted Mission Bit's Demo Day. </p>

                    <b>Story:</b> You’re a magician whose sole duty is to protect your village from hordes and hordes of monsters who are trying to steal your village’s taters(potatoes) in other to make tater tots. As the magician you can never “die” however monsters can attack you and if they bring your HP down to 0 you “die”, but are later revived at your village, well and healthy. However if the village is destroyed, then the game is lost. There are about 16 levels you can play, or you can play the endless Sandbox mode to challenge yourself to an infinite horde. As you beat levels you have the chance to upgrade your magician and/or village to help you and your village to last against the horde, using your spoils of war (gold) and points which can be converted to your magician’s EXP or your magician’s skills. <br>
                    <b>Mechanics:</b> Waves of monsters will spawn during a level, depending on how far you have progressed monsters will either get tougher, increase in number, or both. You must defend your village from the monsters using the magician you control. As the magician you will have a basic attack, skills, and items. Attacks and skills can be upgraded, while items can be bought or picked up as monster drops. You can move left or right to either fall down to the village or engage any enemies. Your village has HP, if that HP reaches zero, you lose. Monsters will gradually bring down your village’s HP when they reach your village. If your village is still standing at the end of the level you win that level and gain points and gold from the level, which is spent on items and/or upgrades
