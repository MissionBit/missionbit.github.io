            Mission Bit provides computer science courses that expose high school students from underserved and underrepresented communities to multiple coding languages. We design our classrooms with project based, small group, learning in mind. Fall and Spring courses run for 13 weeks, 4 hours a week. During the summer, we run intensive introductory and advanced courses that last 6 weeks, respectively. In addition to our classes, we offer students a field trip to a Bay Area tech company, career and college advising related to the technology field, and an opportunity to showcase their group projects to a large community of supporters during our Demo Day event at the end of the term.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no GPA requirements and any San Francisco public or charter school student is encouraged to apply. Given the lack of diversity in the tech industry and our focus on equity, we accept applications from students of color and girls who attend private schools in San Francisco, as well.
        </p>
