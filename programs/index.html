        <p>Mission Bit offers a two year course track that exposes high school students to multiple coding languages. We design our classrooms with an equity lens that emphasizes building community and rigorous learning objectives that focus on building projects. Fall and Spring courses run for 13 weeks, 4 hours a week. During the summer, we run intensive introductory and advanced courses that last four or six weeks, respectively. Each term students take a field trip to a tech company, receive career and college advising related to the technology field, and showcase their projects to a large community of supporters during our Demo Day event at the end of the semester.</p>
        <p>There are no GPA requirements and any student that attends a San Francisco public school is encouraged to apply. Given the lack of diversity in the tech industry and our focus on equity, we consider students of color and female students that attend private schools in San Francisco as well.</p>
