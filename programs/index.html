        <p>Mission Bit offers coding courses which expose high school students from underserved and underrepresented communities to multiple coding languages. We design our classrooms with community and project based learning in mind. Fall and Spring courses run for 13 weeks, 4 hours a week. During the summer, we run intensive introductory and advanced courses that last 6 weeks, respectively. Each term students take a field trip to a tech company, receive career and college advising related to the technology field, and showcase their projects to a large community of supporters during our Demo Day event at the end of the term.</p>
        <p>There are no GPA requirements and any student who attends a San Francisco public school is encouraged to apply. Given the lack of diversity in the tech industry and our focus on equity, we accept applications from students of color and female students who attend private schools in San Francisco as well.</p>
